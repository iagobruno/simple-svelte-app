> Colocar prints do app aqui.

## Getting started

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/iagobruno/simple-svelte-app
> cd simple-svelte-app
> yarn install
> yarn run dev
```

And then open [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the sirv commands in package.json to include the option --host 0.0.0.0.

If you're using Visual Studio Code we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
> npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with npm run start. This uses sirv, which is included in your package.json's dependencies so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like Heroku.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
